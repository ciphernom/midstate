/**
 * @fileoverview Midstate Web Wallet — Worker Thread
 *
 * This Web Worker manages all wallet operations: key derivation, chain scanning,
 * transaction building/signing, and solo mining coordination. It communicates
 * with the main thread (index.html) via postMessage for UI updates and RPC
 * calls (the main thread owns the WebRTC LightClient since RTCPeerConnection
 * is unavailable in workers).
 *
 * ## MSS Tree Storage (IndexedDB)
 *
 * MSS Merkle trees (~64 KB each at height 10) are stored as compact binary
 * blobs in IndexedDB rather than in the encrypted localStorage wallet JSON.
 * This eliminates the 5 MB localStorage limit concern and keeps the wallet
 * JSON lightweight (metadata only). Trees are loaded into the WASM wallet
 * on login via `loadMssCaches()`.
 *
 * ## Key Lifecycle
 *
 * 1. CREATE: Generate mnemonic → derive WOTS keys → generate MSS tree → save
 *    to IndexedDB + localStorage.
 * 2. LOGIN: Decrypt localStorage → construct WebWallet → load MSS trees from
 *    IndexedDB → ready.
 * 3. SEND: prepare_spend (coin selection) → commit → PoW → reveal → confirm.
 * 4. SCAN: Fetch block filters → check for wallet relevance → process matches.
 *
 * @module worker

/**
 * CRITICAL: Safe MSS Signing Helper.
 *
 * MSS/WOTS leaves are ONE-TIME keys: signing twice with the same leaf on two
 * different messages is a catastrophic key-reuse fault, and the node silently
 * evicts any reveal that reuses a burned leaf (mempool prune step 3). Two
 * counters have to agree for that never to happen:
 *
 *   • the WASM tree's internal `kp.next_leaf` (persisted inside the IndexedDB
 *     blob), which is what actually selects the signing leaf, and
 *   • `wState.mssAddrs[addr].next_leaf` (persisted in wState).
 *
 * They drift whenever the two are written at different times — and a rescan, an
 * import, or signing on another device leaves BOTH behind what the chain has
 * already witnessed. So we cross-check against the node before signing and take
 * the MAX of our view and its `getMssState.next_index`, pin BOTH counters to it,
 * sign, then persist the post-increment value atomically. Taking the max can
 * only ever skip forward, never reuse.
 *
 * The node is a CROSS-CHECK, NOT a source of truth. Its two transports disagree:
 * the light/WebRTC path answers from MSS_LEAF_INDEX_TABLE (O(1), full history —
 * correct), while HTTP /mss_state still scans only the last 2000 blocks and
 * returns 0 for any key untouched for ~33 h. We cannot tell which answered, so a
 * LOW answer must never be trusted — hence max(), never assignment. The locally
 * persisted counter remains the primary record; the node can only ever push it
 * forward.

// client actually checks it — an operator who reports a plausible root over the
// wire while paying out something else is indistinguishable from an honest one
// to a miner who never verifies.
//
// Two independent checks run per job:
//
//   1. The root is COMMITTED. Recomputing our own leaf from the /api/proof
//      siblings must reproduce the advertised root — but that only proves the
//      pool's arithmetic is self-consistent. The root must ALSO appear as the
//      salt of a coinbase output paying the pool fee address in the template we
//      are about to burn electricity on. That salt is what gets hashed into the
//      block; anything else is just a number in a JSON response.
//
//   2. Our score is INCLUDED. Once we have any score at all, absence from the
//      tree means the pool is mining a template that cannot pay us.
//
// A miner with zero recorded shares is legitimately absent from the tree, so
// that case is explicitly not treated as fraud.

//
//   • WebRTC (a multiaddr, e.g. /ip4/1.2.3.4/udp/9000/webrtc-direct/certhash/…/p2p/…)
//     Preferred. No CA certificate, no mixed-content block, no CORS, and the
//     pool pushes new jobs instead of the wallet polling for them.
//   • HTTP  (a URL, e.g. https://pool.example:8081)
//     Fallback. Works with curl and existing tooling, but needs TLS to be
//     reachable from an HTTPS-served wallet.
//
// The transport is chosen by inspecting the configured address, so a single
// input field accepts either form.
//
// ## Why WebRTC is proxied to the main thread
// `RTCPeerConnection` does not exist in a Web Worker. This is the same
// constraint that already forces `LightClient` onto the main thread, and it
// applies identically to the pool's libp2p connection. So the WebRTC path posts
// POOL_REQUEST to index.html — which owns the PoolClient — and awaits
// POOL_RESPONSE, mirroring the existing RPC_REQUEST/RPC_RESPONSE bridge above.
// The HTTP path has no such restriction and runs directly here, since `fetch`
// is available in workers.

        //      importing a wallet that scans but cannot sign.
        //   3. Syncs next_leaf BEFORE exporting, then persists the tree to IndexedDB
        //      under mss_<address>, exactly mirroring deriveNextMss().

//  Reorg handling  (reuse-safe)
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// The wallet applies blocks forward-only and, before this, irreversibly: spends
// deleted their input coins, purged WOTS siblings, and set spentWots[addr]=true
// permanently. An orphaned block therefore (a) left phantom credits and, worse,
// (b) could strand real coins — a spend that got reorged out still had its
// inputs deleted and its address poisoned, and addUtxo refuses a poisoned
// address forever, so even a full rescan could not re-credit the coin.
//
// The naive fix — clear spentWots on rollback and restore the coin — is UNSAFE.
// A WOTS key signs exactly one message. When a spend is orphaned, its signature
// (over that tx's commitment) is already public and may still confirm on the
// winning chain or be replayed by anyone. If we simply "un-poison" the address
// and let the wallet spend the restored coin into ANY different transaction, we
// produce a SECOND signature over a DIFFERENT commitment from the same key —
// classic one-time-key reuse, which leaks the key. So the restored coin must be
// spendable ONLY by re-sending the identical original signature (same
// commitment), never by re-signing.
//
// This module implements that. Every mutation is height-tagged. On reorg we roll
// back to the fork height and resolve each restored WOTS spend three ways:
//
//   (1) We still hold the verbatim signed reveal (in sentReveals, retained while
//       re-sendable): re-arm pending_tx with it so the existing recoverPendingTx
//       machinery re-broadcasts the SAME signature. Reuse-safe, automatic.
//   (2) We no longer hold the reveal (spend was buried and pruned) but the
//       address is poisoned: restore the coin in a REUSE-LOCKED state and
//       surface it to the user. The wallet will not auto-spend it; the only
//       safe options are user-driven and explained in the UI.
//   (3) MSS inputs: no per-key reuse cliff (leaf counters are reconciled with
//       the node), so these are restored normally.

// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//  Q-BOLT v2 — Spilman channel engine (the "reality" layer)
//
//  Direction: every channel has exactly one SENDER (funds it, signs every
//  balance state) and one RECEIVER (validates + stores states, signs nothing
//  until close). The funding covenant is:
//      IF   2-of-2(sender, receiver)                 → close (receiver-driven)
//      ELSE height ≥ expiry + sender signature       → refund (sender-driven)
//
//  Safety invariants enforced here:
//    · The receiver's floor (their balance) only ever rises — enforced on
//      every inbound state. Replaying an old state can only pay them less.
//    · The sender never holds a receiver signature, so the sender cannot
//      broadcast ANY balance state — their only unilateral exit is the
//      time-locked refund.
//    · A commitment is single-shot on-chain and expires COMMITMENT_TTL
//      blocks after being mined. We therefore NEVER commit a state until a
//      close is actually in flight, and every retry that needs a fresh
//      commitment bumps `attempt` (which changes the tx salt).
//    · Every state transition is persisted BEFORE the network action that
//      depends on it, and every in-flight close is resumable from disk.
