//! # Provably Fair Stratum Pool
//!
//! This module implements a decentralized-auditable mining pool. Unlike traditional 
//! Stratum pools where miners must blindly trust the operator to report shares and 
//! distribute rewards fairly, this pool embeds an SPV-style **Merkle Precommitment** 
//! into every block template.
//!
//! Miners can query the HTTP Audit API (`/api/proof`) to receive a cryptographic 
//! proof that their exact accumulated score was included in the block's coinbase 
//! transaction *before* they begin hashing. If the pool operator lies or omits them, 
//! the miner's local client instantly detects the mismatch and disconnects.
//!
//! ## Security Mitigations Implemented
//! 1. **Replay Protection (`valid_shares`)**: Prevents "Infinite Money" glitches where 
//!    a miner resubmits the same valid nonce millions of times per second.
//! 2. **CPU Exhaustion Defense (`spawn_blocking`)**: Offloads the 1,000,000-iteration 
//!    BLAKE3 VDF from the async reactor, preventing remote DoS attacks.
//! 3. **Conditional Score Deduction**: Prevents "Orphan Theft" by waiting for the 
//!    network to explicitly `HTTP 200 OK` the block before wiping the miners' shares.
//! 4. **Tandem Port Binding**: Binds the Stratum TCP port and Audit HTTP port simultaneously
//!    to guarantee they never desync due to ghost processes holding TCP sockets open.
//! 5. **Checksum-Agnostic Ingestion**: Strips 4-byte UI checksums from user-supplied 
//!    addresses before hashing to prevent silent HTTP 400 rejection loops from the core node.

// ── Main Server Boot ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

/// Boots the Provably Fair Stratum Server and its companion HTTP Audit API.
///
/// # Architecture
/// This server is designed to run independently from the core Midstate node. 
/// In professional mining setups, the core node is heavily firewalled or hidden 
/// behind a VPN (e.g., Tailscale), while the Stratum server is exposed to the 
/// public internet.
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `pool_address` - The Midstate address where the pool fee will be sent.
/// * `bind_addr` - The `IP:PORT` to bind the Stratum TCP server to (e.g., `0.0.0.0:3333`).
///                 The HTTP Audit API will automatically bind to an offset port (e.g., `8081`).
/// * `node_rpc_url` - The HTTP URL of the backend Midstate node (e.g., `http://10.0.0.5:8545`).
/// * `pool_fee_percent` - The percentage of the block reward taken by the pool (e.g., 1.0).
/// * `share_bits` - Share difficulty in leading zero bits. `None` uses
///   [`DEFAULT_SHARE_BITS`]. Every share is worth exactly one point of score
///   regardless of this value, so changing it mid-round rescales what a point
///   costs: raise it and existing score becomes relatively more valuable, lower
///   it and new shares are cheaper than the ones already banked. Change it
///   between blocks, not during one, or set it once and leave it.
/// * `webrtc_port` - UDP port for the browser-facing webrtc-direct listener.
///   `None` disables it, leaving Stratum + HTTP only.

// ── HTTP Mining Protocol (browser / web-wallet miners) ──────────────────────
//
// Browsers cannot open raw TCP sockets, so the web wallet can never speak
// Stratum. These two endpoints expose the *same* job and the *same* share
// pipeline over plain request/response HTTP on the audit port:
//
//   GET  /api/template?address=<addr>   → the current job
//   POST /api/submit  {job_id, nonce, address, worker} → share result
//
// The protocol is deliberately poll-based rather than push-based. A browser
// miner runs at single-digit hashes per second (one nonce is a 1,000,000-round
// sequential BLAKE3 chain), so it produces a share every few minutes and a
// one-second template poll is already far finer-grained than it needs.
//
// # Why submissions carry only (job_id, nonce)
// The obvious shape — have the client POST the finished `batch` it just mined —
// is unsafe: the batch contains the coinbase, so a miner could rewrite the
// payout addresses to send the entire block reward to themselves and the pool
// would faithfully relay it to the node. A `job_id` plus a `nonce` is the
// complete proof-of-work claim; the pool rebuilds the block from the template
// it generated and still holds. There is nothing miner-supplied in the block.

// ── WebRTC Transport (browser miners, no TLS / no CORS / push-based) ─────────
//
// A second front door onto exactly the same job and share pipeline as Stratum
// and HTTP. Browsers cannot open raw TCP, and reaching the HTTP port from an
// HTTPS-served wallet requires a CA-signed certificate on the pool. libp2p's
// webrtc-direct sidesteps both: the connection is authenticated by a certificate
// hash embedded in the multiaddr, so there is no domain, no CA, and no
// mixed-content block — the same trick `light_client.js` already uses to reach
// full nodes.
//
// The decisive advantage over HTTP is not the transport, it is that streams are
// bidirectional and long-lived. The HTTP path has browsers polling once a second
// and receiving the entire `batch_template` — every transaction in the block —
// even when nothing has changed. Here the pool subscribes each connected miner
// to the *same* `job_notifier` broadcast the Stratum handler uses and pushes
// `notify` the instant a job rotates, which also closes the stale-work window
// (with 60s blocks and 1s polling, miners burn up to ~1.6% of their work on
// templates that are already dead).
//
// Framing and protocol shape deliberately mirror `light_protocol.rs`: 4-byte
// little-endian length prefix followed by JSON, one request/response per stream,
// pushes as one-shot server-initiated streams. The wallet's existing
// `/midstate/light-push/2.0.0` reader works the same way, so the client side is
// a near-copy of code that already works.

///   cleared per **block**, while jobs rotate more often than blocks (any
///   template rebuild on the same tip). A burned entry would reject that nonce
///   for the remainder of the block even though the new job's midstate makes it
///   legitimately re-mineable.
/// - **Score is credited at most once per (job, nonce).** Enforced by `seen`,
///   which is why its correctness is a payout property and not just a
///   performance one.
/// - **`is_block` is decided from the same hash that cleared `share_target`,**
///   never recomputed, so a share and the block it may also solve can never
///   disagree.
/// - **This is the single entry point for both transports.** Any invariant above
///   holds for Stratum, HTTP and WebRTC identically, because none of them may
