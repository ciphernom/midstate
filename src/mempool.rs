//! # Flat Mempool with Replace-By-Fee (RBF)
//!
//! This module implements a highly efficient, priority-sorted memory pool for pending transactions.
//! Because Midstate uses a two-phase Commit/Reveal protocol, unconfirmed transaction chaining
//! (CPFP) is structurally impossible. Therefore, the mempool is implemented as a flat,
//! zero-dependency list optimized purely for Replace-By-Fee (RBF) and PoW-based spam resistance.
//!
//! ## Architecture
//! The mempool is split into two independent, capacity-bounded pools:
//!
//! 1. **Commits** (up to `MAX_PENDING_COMMITS`): Sorted by Proof-of-Work difficulty.
//!    The weakest commit is evicted first.
//! 2. **Reveals** (up to `MAX_MEMPOOL_REVEALS` / `MAX_MEMPOOL_BYTES`): Sorted by Fee Rate.
//!    The cheapest reveal is evicted first.
//!
//! Both pools use a `HashMap` for O(1) lookup by key and a `BTreeSet` as a priority index,
//! giving O(log N) insertion, eviction, and minimum-finding.
